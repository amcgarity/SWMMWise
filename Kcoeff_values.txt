Conductivity slope measures the rate at which a soil's hydraulic conductivity decreases with decreasing moisture content. SWMM uses the following equation to express this relationship:

K = Ksat * exp(-HCO * (porosity - moisture content))
where Ksat is the saturated conductivity and HCO is the conductivity slope. The partly saturated K-value is used to predict the rate at which infiltrated water moves through a layer of unsaturated soil when modeling groundwater or LID controls.

HCO can be estimated as the slope of a best fit line through a plot of Log(K) versus moisture content if such data are available for a particular soil. Below is a table of HCO values for different soil types derived by using an analogy with Mualem's equation for K:
